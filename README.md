# USENIX LISA Labs 2017
## Getting Started
Welcome to Labs. Each of the labs has a VirtualBox VM for your conviencence. Once you've joined the `LISALABS` network, you can download the files from [our webserver](http://service.lisalabs/virtualbox/).

>**Note:** I've had some difficulty getting port forwarding and VM/Internet connectivity working correctly with the Virtual Box OSE 4.3. I'd recommend using the Oracle packages if you encounter problems.

The directions for this lab set are available at:

- [Metrics with Influx/Grafana](https://github.com/ultramathman/lisalabs17/blob/master/influxdb_grafana.md)

- [HA InfluxDB](https://github.com/ultramathman/lisalabs17/blob/master/influxdb_ha.md)

- [Docker Basics](https://github.com/ultramathman/lisalabs17/blob/master/docker.md)
